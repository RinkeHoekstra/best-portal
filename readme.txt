BestPortal v0.2
===============

BestPortal is a PHP-based portal for lightweight semantic access to court proceedings published by the Netherlands Council for the Judiciary. It uses Semantic Web technology (OWL, RDF, SPARQL) and inferencing for computing the translation from a layman description of a court case, to its legal equivalent. Mappings between the two vocabularies are defined using the BestMap ontology.

See http://www.best-project.nl for more information about BestPortal and BestMap.
